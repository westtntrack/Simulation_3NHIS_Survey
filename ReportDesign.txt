#### DAX Measures to Create
```
// Poverty-related measures
Avg POVRATIO = AVERAGE(vw_NHIS_Combined[POVRATIO])
Avg POVRATIO YoY Change = 
    CALCULATE([Avg POVRATIO], SurveyYear = "2023") - 
    CALCULATE([Avg POVRATIO], SurveyYear = "2022")

Below Poverty Line % = 
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTX(FILTER(vw_NHIS_Combined, [POVRATIO] < 1.0), 1),
        COUNTX(vw_NHIS_Combined, 1)
    )

// Hypertension-related measures
HYPEV Rate = 
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTX(FILTER(vw_NHIS_Combined, [HYPEV] = 1), 1),
        COUNTX(vw_NHIS_Combined, 1)
    )
    
HYPEV YoY Change = 
    CALCULATE([HYPEV Rate], SurveyYear = "2023") - 
    CALCULATE([HYPEV Rate], SurveyYear = "2022")
    
Medication Rate Among Diagnosed HYP = 
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTX(FILTER(vw_NHIS_Combined, [HYPEV] = 1 && [HYPMED] = 1), 1),
        COUNTX(FILTER(vw_NHIS_Combined, [HYPEV] = 1), 1)
    )

// Anxiety-related measures
ANXDIAG Rate = 
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTX(FILTER(vw_NHIS_Combined, [ANXDIAG] = 1), 1),
        COUNTX(vw_NHIS_Combined, 1)
    )
    
ANXDIAG YoY Change = 
    CALCULATE([ANXDIAG Rate], SurveyYear = "2023") - 
    CALCULATE([ANXDIAG Rate], SurveyYear = "2022")
    
Severe Anxiety % = 
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTX(FILTER(vw_NHIS_Combined, [ANXLEVEL] = 3), 1),
        COUNTX(FILTER(vw_NHIS_Combined, [ANXDIAG] = 1), 1)
    )

// Relationship measures
HYP-ANX Comorbidity Rate = 
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTX(FILTER(vw_NHIS_Combined, [HYPEV] = 1 && [ANXDIAG] = 1), 1),
        COUNTX(vw_NHIS_Combined, 1)
